    <h2>Large Company Inc.</h2>
    
    <h3>PART I</h3>
    <h4>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h4>
    
    <p>The Company faces significant cybersecurity risks including data breaches, unauthorized access, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities. These threats are constantly evolving and could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, disruption of operations, financial losses, and damage to our reputation.</p>
    
    <p>We are subject to extensive government regulation in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. Changes in regulatory requirements, new regulations, or enforcement actions could result in substantial compliance costs, restrictions on our operations, penalties, or other adverse consequences that could materially impact our financial results and competitive position.</p>
    
    <p>Our business depends on a complex global supply chain involving numerous suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners across multiple countries. Disruptions due to natural disasters, geopolitical events, trade restrictions, supplier failures, labor disputes, or other factors could significantly impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products to customers, resulting in lost sales and increased costs.</p>
    
    <p>We face intense competition in our markets from both established companies and new entrants. Competitive pressures could result in reduced market share, lower profit margins, loss of key customers, or require us to increase spending on research and development, marketing, or other competitive initiatives.</p>
    
    <p>Economic downturns, inflation, currency fluctuations, changes in consumer spending patterns, and other macroeconomic factors could materially affect demand for our products and services, leading to reduced revenue and profitability. We may not be able to quickly adjust our cost structure to respond to these changes.</p>
    
    <p>We are exposed to litigation risk from various sources including product liability claims, intellectual property disputes, employment-related matters, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings. Adverse outcomes could result in substantial monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other remedies that could materially harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.</p>
    
    <p>We rely on key personnel, including our executive officers, senior management team, and other critical employees. The loss of these individuals, particularly without adequate succession planning, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and maintain our competitive position.</p>
    
    <p>Our intellectual property is critical to our competitive position. Failure to protect our IP rights, successful challenges to our patents, trademarks, or other IP, or infringement claims by third parties could materially harm our business and financial results. We may also face increasing costs to defend or enforce our IP rights.</p>
    
    <p>We depend on third-party technology and services for critical business functions including cloud computing, payment processing, customer relationship management, and other systems. Interruptions, security breaches, or failures of these third-party systems could disrupt our operations, expose us to liability, and damage our reputation with customers.</p>
    
    <p>Climate change and environmental regulations could impose additional costs, operational restrictions, or require significant capital expenditures to comply with new requirements. These factors could affect our supply chain, manufacturing operations, and overall profitability. We may also face increased scrutiny from investors, customers, and regulators regarding our environmental practices.</p>
