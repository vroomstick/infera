- **Natural Disasters and External Disruptions**: The company's operations and supply chain are vulnerable to natural disasters, industrial accidents, and other external disruptions, which can lead to significant operational interruptions, financial losses, and delays in product delivery. The increasing frequency and intensity of such events due to global climate change exacerbate these risks.

- **Supply Chain and Outsourcing Risks**: The company's reliance on a concentrated group of outsourcing partners, primarily located in Asia, poses risks related to production control, quality assurance, and responsiveness to market changes. Any disruption or violation of supplier agreements can adversely impact the company's operations and reputation.

- **Product and Service Quality Issues**: The complexity of the company's hardware and software offerings increases the risk of defects and performance issues, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction, product liability claims, and damage to the company's reputation. These issues can also result in financial liabilities and hinder the introduction of new products and services.

- **Cybersecurity and Data Security Threats**: The company faces significant risks from cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks, which can disrupt operations and compromise sensitive data. While insurance coverage is maintained, it may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses or claims.
