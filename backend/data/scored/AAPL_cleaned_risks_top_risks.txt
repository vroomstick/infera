many of the company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. in addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the company’s control. global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. following an interruption to its business, the company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company.

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the company’s business, and harm to the company’s reputation. major public health issues, including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.

the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties. component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. in addition, the company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. as a result, from time to time the company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services. in addition, the company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services, and result in harm to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.

--- RISK #4 (Score: 0.0443) ---
substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland, india, japan, south korea, taiwan and vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. changes or additions to the company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution. such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
